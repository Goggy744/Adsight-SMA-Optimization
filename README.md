# AdSight: Marketing and Advertising Optimization through Eye Tracking

## Overview

**AdSight** is a research-based project aimed at optimizing digital marketing and advertising through **eye-tracking technology**. It combines **scientific research** on eye-tracking metrics with a **technical implementation** that collects and analyzes real-world user gaze data on a simulated social media feed.

This project was developed as part of a **Bachelor Semester Project** at the **University of Luxembourg**.

## Features

✅ **Scientific Insights**: Research-based approach on **eye tracking & digital marketing**  
✅ **Instagram-like Simulation**: A web-based **clone of Instagram** for controlled eye-tracking experiments  
✅ **Real-time Interaction Tracking**: Logs **scrolling, likes, and call-to-action button clicks**  
✅ **Eye-tracking Data Collection**: Uses **Gazepoint GP3 Eye Tracker** for gaze analysis  
✅ **Data Visualization**: Fixation heatmaps, scanpath analysis, and eye movement insights  
✅ **Python Flask Web Application**: Simple backend to host and track user interactions  


## Technologies Used
- Python: Backend development with Flask
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Frontend for the Instagram-like simulation
- Gazepoint GP3: Eye-tracking hardware for data collection
- Matplotlib, Pandas: Data visualization and analysis

## Dataset Collection
- Eye-tracking Metrics: Gaze points, fixations, saccades, pupil dilation
- User Interaction Data: Scroll position, click events, time spent on ads
- Experiment Logs: Timestamps of actions and user behavior tracking

## Analysis & Insights
- Fixation Heatmaps: Visualizing areas of interest in advertisements
- Scanpath Visualization: Tracking gaze movement across content
- Consumer Engagement Metrics: Evaluating ad effectiveness using gaze duration and fixation count
- Competitive Clutter Analysis: Understanding how ad placement impacts user attention
